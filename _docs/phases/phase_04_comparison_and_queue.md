# Phase 4: Comparison and Queue

## Phase Overview
This phase implements the functionality to compare local and remote files, identify missing files, and build a download queue with rate limiting.

## Tasks
- Implement file comparison logic based on filename, size, and category
- Create the download queue management system
- Implement rate limiting for downloads
- Update the UI to display comparison results and the download queue
- Add functionality to prioritize and reorder the download queue

## Dependencies
- Phase 2: Local Scan (local file information)
- Phase 3: Remote Scan (remote file information)

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application accurately compares local and remote files to identify missing files
- Users can view the comparison results by category
- The download queue is populated with missing files
- Users can prioritize, reorder, or remove items from the download queue
- Rate limiting is applied to prevent overloading the remote server
- The UI clearly displays the comparison results and download queue status
