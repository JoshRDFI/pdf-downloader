# Phase 2: Local Scan

## Phase Overview
This phase implements the functionality to scan the local directory structure for existing files, extract metadata, and update the database with this information.

## Tasks
- Implement directory scanning functionality
- Create file metadata extraction for different file types (PDF, EPUB, TXT)
- Update the database schema to store local file information
- Implement the UI for selecting and scanning local directories
- Add progress reporting for the scanning process

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Site Management (database schema and basic UI)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can select a local root directory to scan
- The application recursively scans the directory and identifies relevant files
- File metadata (name, size, path, type, etc.) is extracted and stored in the database
- The scanning process shows progress and can be cancelled
- The UI displays the results of the scan, including file counts by category
- The database is properly updated with local file information
