# Phase 8: Modular Extensions

## Phase Overview
This phase implements the modular extension system for adding new scrapers and supporting new file types.

## Tasks
- Implement a plugin system for adding new scrapers
- Create documentation for developing new scrapers
- Add support for additional file types (EPUB, TXT, etc.)
- Implement file type detection and validation for new types
- Create a testing framework for scrapers

## Dependencies
- Phase 1-7 (all previous phases)

## Acceptance Criteria
- New scrapers can be added without modifying the core application code
- Documentation clearly explains how to develop new scrapers
- Additional file types are supported with proper validation
- File type detection works correctly for all supported types
- The testing framework allows for validating scraper functionality
- The application gracefully handles unsupported file types
