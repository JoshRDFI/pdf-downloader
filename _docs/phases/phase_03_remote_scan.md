# Phase 3: Remote Scan

## Phase Overview
This phase implements the functionality to scrape remote sites for available files and categories, updating the database with this information.

## Tasks
- Implement site-specific scrapers for supported websites
- Create the scraping logic to extract file and category information
- Update the database schema to store remote file information
- Implement the UI for initiating and monitoring remote scans
- Add error handling and retry mechanisms for network operations

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Site Management (database schema and scraper framework)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can select a site to scan from their saved sites
- The application scrapes the site for available files and categories
- Remote file metadata (name, size, URL, category, etc.) is extracted and stored in the database
- The scraping process shows progress and can be cancelled
- The UI displays the results of the scan, including file counts by category
- The database is properly updated with remote file information
- Error handling gracefully manages network issues and invalid responses
