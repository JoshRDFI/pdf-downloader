# Phase 3 Implementation: Remote Scanning and File Comparison

## Overview
This phase implements the remote file scanning functionality and file comparison between local and remote files. This allows users to identify new, updated, and corrupted files, and build a download queue.

## Components Implemented

### Database Models
- **RemoteFileModel**: Manages remote file data in the database, providing CRUD operations for remote files.
- **Enhanced LocalFileModel**: Added methods to find files by remote ID and manage the connection between local and remote files.

### Core Components
- **FileComparisonService**: Compares local and remote files, identifies new, updated, and corrupted files, and builds a download queue.

### GUI Components
- **ComparisonTab**: Provides a user interface for comparing local and remote files, showing the connection status, and managing the download queue.
  - File comparison by site
  - Display of new, updated, corrupted, and OK files
  - Context menus for adding files to the download queue

## Features
- Compare local and remote files
- Identify new files (exist remotely but not locally)
- Identify updated files (exist in both places but with different sizes/checksums)
- Identify corrupted files (local files that fail validation)
- Link local files to remote files
- Build a download queue based on comparison results

## UI Improvements
- Added a File Comparison tab to the main window
- Implemented file comparison by site
- Added tables for different file categories (new, updated, corrupted, OK)
- Added context menus for file actions
- Added progress tracking during comparison

## Connection Between Local and Remote Files
The connection between local and remote files is maintained through the database schema:

1. In the `local_files` table, there's a `remote_file_id` field that references the `id` field in the `remote_files` table.
2. This foreign key relationship allows us to track which local files correspond to which remote files.

The comparison process works as follows:

1. During remote scanning, files are identified and stored in the `remote_files` table.
2. During comparison, local files are matched with remote files using the `remote_file_id` field.
3. Files are categorized as new, updated, corrupted, or OK based on the comparison results.
4. Users can add files to the download queue based on these categories.

## Next Steps
- Implement Phase 4: Download Management
- Enhance file comparison with more metadata
- Add file preview functionality
- Implement file categorization based on content
