# Phase 2 Implementation: Local File Scanning

## Overview
This phase implements the local file scanning functionality, which allows users to scan local directories for PDF, EPUB, and text files, extract metadata, and store the information in the database.

## Components Implemented

### Database Models
- **LocalFileModel**: Manages local file data in the database, providing CRUD operations for local files.

### Core Components
- **DirectoryScanner**: Scans local directories for files, extracts metadata, and updates the database.
- **FileValidator**: Validates different types of files (PDF, EPUB, text) to ensure they are valid and readable.

### GUI Components
- **LocalLibraryTab**: Provides a user interface for managing local directories and viewing local files.
  - Directory management (add, remove, scan)
  - File filtering by type
  - File statistics display
  - Progress tracking during scans

### Utility Functions
- Enhanced **file_utils.py** with functions for:
  - File validation for different file types
  - Metadata extraction from PDF, EPUB, and text files
  - File type detection

### Configuration
- Added local library configuration to **config.py**:
  - Directory management
  - Scan settings
  - File type preferences

## Features
- Scan local directories for PDF, EPUB, and text files
- Extract and store file metadata
- View and filter local files by type
- Track scan progress with a progress bar
- Cancel ongoing scans

- Validate files to ensure they are readable

## UI Improvements
- Added a Local Library tab to the main window
- Implemented directory management with add/remove functionality
- Added file filtering by type
- Added progress tracking during scans
- Added file statistics display

## Next Steps
- Implement Phase 3: Remote Scanning
